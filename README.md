# Lightning Service Provider Spec
API specifications for Lightning Service Providers (LSP)

The goal of this repository is to provide a unified API specification for Lightning Service Providers (LSP) to create interoperability between different Lightning Network wallets/clients and LSPs.

The group meets every second week on Wednesday 11am UTC. The meeting is open to everyone. Please join the [Telegram group][] for more information.

## Status Specification

All LSPS specifications include a "Status" field.
"Status" can be one of the following:

* "For Implementation" - The specification has been widely reviewed by
  LSPS participants, is believed to have addressed all raised
  issues, and LSPS participants recommend this specification to be
  implemented.
* "Stable" - The specification has been implemented by at least one
  client and one LSP, which are developed by at least two different
  organizations or open-source project teams, and both development
  teams have reported interoperability without further modifications
  or clarifications of the specification.

## Specs

### **LSPS0** [Transport Layer](LSPS0/README.md)
